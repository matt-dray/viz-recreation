# viz-recreation

R code to recreate or remix art and visualisations as part of challenges
like
[\#RecreationThursday](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday).

The code and outputs for each attempt are in their own subfolder of this
repo. Each has a README with an explanation and previews of the results.

You can find many of these outputs in the
[faxcrayon.art](https://www.faxcrayon.art) 📠🖍 gallery.
