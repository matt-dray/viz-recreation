Week 1 (2021-06-03) of
[\#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RecreationThursday&src=typed_query),
curated by Natalie O’Shea: [Alfredo Hlito’s *Curves and Straight* series
(1948)](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/205953). My attempt used
base R functions only.

My attempt:

<div class="figure">

<img src="output/recreate-hlito.png" alt="A recreation of Curves and Straight Lines (1948) by Alfred Hlito, which is an oil painting of colorful geometric lines on a cream background. Starting at the top of the painting in the middle there is a dark yellow curve. Intersecting it in the center of the painting is a black line at a 45 degree angle and a dark blue curve. In the top right of the center area there are short horizontal black blue green and red lines. In the top left of the center area are horizontal green red blue and black lines. In the bottom left of the center there is a short horizontal red line." width="50%"/>

</div>

I randomly adjusted the element geometry 100 times:

<div class="figure">

<img src="output/remix-hlito-100.png" alt="A recreation of Curves and Straight Lines (1948) by Alfred Hlito. This version is a 10 by 10 grid of reproductions of Hlito's original, where randomisation has been introduced into each panel to vary the length and placement of the elements: a horizontal black stripe, several short horizontal lines of various colours and two circles, one blue, one dark yellow; all on a cream background." width="50%"/>

</div>

And here’s a gif of 10 of these randomised images:

<div class="figure">

<img src="output/gif/remix-hlito_max.gif" alt="A recreation of Curves and Straight Lines (1948) by Alfred Hlito. This version is an animated gif where each frame is a new veresion of Hlito's original with randomisation that varies the length and placement of the elements: a horizontal black stripe, several short horizontal lines of various colours and two circles, one blue, one dark yellow; all on a cream background." width="50%"/>
