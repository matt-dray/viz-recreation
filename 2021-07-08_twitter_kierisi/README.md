## Jesse’s disliked-colours composition

From [a
tweet](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1412925861255421953?s=20) by
Jesse Mostipak ([@kierisi](https://twitter.com/kierisi/)):

> the assignment was to choose four colors we dislike – two intense and
> two neutral – and then paint a composition in which the colors are all
> touching one another.

I recreated it quickly using the method from [my ‘pixel art’
approach](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/06/28/pixel-art/) using base R.

My recreation:

<div class="figure">

<img src="output/kierisi-recreate.png" alt="A cross-shape composed of coloured squares of four colours. All combinations of colour touch each other at least once. A recreation of Jesse Mostipak's original composition." width="50%"/>

</div>
