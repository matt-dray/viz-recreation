# viz-recreation

R code to recreate or remix art and visualisations as part of challenges like [#RecreationThursday](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday).

The code and outputs for each attempt are in their own subfolder of this repo. Each has a README with an explanation and previews of the results.

You can find many of these outputs in the  [faxcrayon.art](https://www.faxcrayon.art) `r emo::ji("fax")``r emo::ji("crayon")` gallery.
